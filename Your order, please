# Your task is to sort a given string. 
Each word in the string will contain a single number. 
This number is the position the word should have in the result.

# Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. 
So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

# If the input string is empty, return an empty string. 
The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.
