# Write a function, factory, that takes a number as its parameter and returns another function.

# The returned function should take an array of numbers as its parameter, and return an array of those numbers multiplied by the number that was passed into the first function.

# In the example below, 5 is the number passed into the first function. So it returns a function that takes an array and multiplies all elements in it by five.
