# Our football team has finished the championship.

# Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

# Points are awarded for each match as follows:

'''
if x > y: 3 points (win)
if x < y: 0 points (loss)
if x = y: 1 point (tie)
'''

# We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.
