# In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave. You will be passed a string and you must return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person standing up.


# 1.  The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.

# 2.  If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as if it was an empty seat
